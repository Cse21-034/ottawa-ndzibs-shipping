# Deployment Configuration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Render Deployment Errors
**Problem**: Render was looking for `/opt/render/project/src/dist/index.js` but finding the file at wrong path
**Root Cause**: 
- render.yaml was referencing non-existent `backend` directory
- Build commands were trying to cd into `backend` directory that was removed during migration

**Solution**: 
- Updated render.yaml to work with unified project structure
- Created `build-backend.js` script to build only server components
- Fixed build and start commands to work from project root

### 2. Vercel Configuration Issues  
**Problem**: vercel.json was pointing to removed `frontend` directory
**Root Cause**: Configuration files weren't updated after migrating from separate frontend/backend structure

**Solution**:
- Updated vercel.json to use project root and correct build paths
- Configured to build only frontend assets with `vite build`
- Set correct output directory to `dist/public`

### 3. File Cleanup
**Removed**:
- Duplicate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories 
- Unused log files from node_modules
- Old prompt/pasted text files from attached_assets

**Added**:
- `.gitignore` for proper version control
- `build-backend.js` for Render-specific backend builds
- `build-frontend.js` for Vercel-specific frontend builds (if needed)

## Current Deployment Structure

```
ottawa-ndzibs-shipping/
├── server/              # Backend source code
├── client/              # Frontend source code  
├── shared/              # Shared types/schemas
├── render.yaml          # Render deployment config
├── vercel.json          # Vercel deployment config
├── build-backend.js     # Backend-only build script
└── dist/                # Build output
    ├── index.js         # Built backend (for Render)
    └── public/          # Built frontend (for Vercel)
```

## Deployment Commands

### Backend (Render)
- **Install**: `npm install`
- **Build**: `node build-backend.js`  
- **Start**: `npm start`
- **Output**: `dist/index.js`

### Frontend (Vercel)
- **Install**: `npm install`
- **Build**: `vite build`
- **Output**: `dist/public/`

## Verification

✅ Backend build script works (`node build-backend.js`)
✅ Frontend build works (`vite build`) 
✅ Unified project structure maintained
✅ No duplicate directories
✅ Clean file structure
✅ Proper .gitignore in place

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit all changes
2. **Deploy Backend**: Use Render with the updated render.yaml
3. **Deploy Frontend**: Use Vercel with the updated vercel.json  
4. **Set Environment Variables**: As documented in DEPLOYMENT.md
5. **Test Integration**: Verify frontend can connect to backend API
